# Blackjack Game

A simple Blackjack game implemented in Python. Play against the computer (dealer) and try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HaileyLoppy/blackjack-game.git
2. cd blackjack-game
3. python blackjack.py

## Rules
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
You can 'hit' to draw another card or 'stand' to keep your current hand.
The dealer must hit until their hand reaches at least 17.
If you go over 21, you bust and lose the game.
If the dealer busts, you win.
Otherwise, the player with the higher hand value wins.
